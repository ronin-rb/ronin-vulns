    #
    # Represents a (Reflected) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    #
    # ## Features
    #
    # * Tests a URL with just one HTTP request (per param).
    # * Tests which HTML special characters are allowed.
    # * Identifies the context, tag name, and/or attribute name of the XSS.
    # * Determines viability of XSS based on the context.
    # * Includes random data in the test values.
